1) Copy gitPush.app to your hard drive. /Applications/Utilities/ would be fitting.
2) Drag your local copy of gitPush.app to your Finder toolbar and wait for the toolbar to make room for it. Drop it like it's hot.

USAGE
After making edits to your repo files you need to commit the changes. I recommend GitX for that.
With the commits made, in Finder navigate to the root of your repo.
Click the gitPush button in the Finder toolbar. The octocat will go chromatic while it's working. When it goes monochrome again its done.
